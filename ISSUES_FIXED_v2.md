# 🎉 All Issues Fixed!

## ✅ Issues Resolved:

### 1. **Duplicate Header Issue** ✅
   - **Problem**: Two headers were showing (one from layout.tsx, one from booking page)
   - **Solution**: Removed Header and Footer from booking page since layout.tsx already includes them
   - **Result**: Now only one header displays across all pages

### 2. **Prices Not Updating on Selection** ✅
   - **Problem**: When clicking different vehicles, prices remained static at $40
   - **Solution**: 
     - Added `selectedCar` state to track which vehicle is selected
     - Made vehicle cards clickable with visual feedback (orange border when selected)
     - Prices now calculate dynamically based on selected vehicle
     - Tax calculation is now percentage-based (10.5% of base amount)
   - **Result**: 
     - Click any vehicle to select it
     - Summary updates instantly with new prices
     - Total recalculates automatically

### 3. **Confirmation Message Updated** ✅
   - **Problem**: Page said "Booking Confirmed!" which was misleading
   - **Solution**: Changed message to "Check WhatsApp to Confirm Your Booking!"
   - **Updated Text**:
     - Title: "Check WhatsApp to Confirm Your Booking!"
     - Subtitle: "We've sent a confirmation message to your WhatsApp. Please check your phone."
     - Call-to-action: "Check your WhatsApp for booking confirmation"
   - **Result**: Clear instructions for users to check their WhatsApp

## 🎨 New Features Added:

### Interactive Vehicle Selection:
- ✅ **Click to select** any vehicle
- ✅ **Visual feedback**: Selected vehicle has orange border and light orange background
- ✅ **Hover effect**: Vehicles highlight on hover
- ✅ **Cursor changes**: Pointer cursor indicates clickable cards

### Dynamic Price Calculation:
```
Base Price: $40, $43, or $45 per day (depends on selection)
Days: Calculated from pickup/return dates
Tax: 10.5% of base amount (dynamic)
Surcharge: $3.99
Registration Fee: $2.99
CCP: $4.00
Trip Fee: $9.99
Total: Automatically calculated
```

### Example Price Updates:
- **Intermediate ICAR** (1 day): $40 + $4.20 tax = $65.17 total
- **Fullsize FCAR** (1 day): $43 + $4.52 tax = $68.49 total
- **Standard SCAR** (1 day): $45 + $4.73 tax = $70.70 total
